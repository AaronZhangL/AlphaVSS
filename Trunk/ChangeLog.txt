Version 1.0alpha
-------------------
* New exception, UnsupportedOperatingSystemException added.

* VssSnapshotContext is now an enumeration.

* Support for methods from IVssExamineWriterMetadataEx and 
  IVssExamineWriterMetadataEx2 added to IVssExamineWriterMetadata.

* Support for methods from IVssBackupComponentsEx and IVssBackupComponentsEx2
  added to IVssBackupComponents.

* IVssSnapshotManagement and IDifferentialSoftwareSnapshotManagement interfaces and 
  classes added.

* VssWriterFailure enumeration removed, with new VssError enumeration containing
  all VSS error codes.

* Class OperatingSystemInfo added to AlphaVSS.Common, replacing old OSInfo 
  in AlphaVSS.Platform together with OSVersionName and ProcessorArchitecture 
  enumerations.

* Target-framework for AlphaVSS.Common changed to .NET 2.0.

* Binary release now has a Strong Name, also used during dynamic loading of 
  assemblies. Public key distributed with source.

* API documentation updated, all links now correct and documentation complete.

* Bug: IVssExamineWriterMetadata did not implement IDisposable, fixed.

* VssAsync, VssBackupComponents, VssComponent, VssExamineWriterMetadata, VssWMComponent 
  and VssWriterComponents have been made private classes and should instead be used through
  their corresponding interfaces, IVssAsync, IVssBackupComponents, IVssComponent, 
  IVssExamineWriterMetadata, IVssWMComponent and IVssWriterComponents.

* IsVolumeSnapshotted, GetSnapshotComatibility and ShouldBlockRevert moved from
  VssBackupComponents to (I)VssImplementation.
  
* IVssImplementation and VssUtils added to provide generic access to the implementation
  of VSS for the relevant platform.
    
* Order of parameters in IVssBackupComponents.AddToSnapshotSet() changed and an 
  additional overload provided.

* VssExamineWriterMetadata.Create() removed and replaced with 
  IVssImplementation.CreateVssExamineWriterMetadata().
  
* DeleteSnapshots replaced with DeleteSnapshot and DeleteSnapshotSet methods.

* Source folder structure changed

* Refactoring of assemblies, moving platform independent code out to 
  new assembly, AlphaVSS.Common.

* VssUnexpectedProviderError renamed to VssUnexpectedProviderErrorException

* VssUnexpectedWriterError renamed to VssUnexpectedWriterErrorException

* VssDifferencedFileInfo.FileSpec renamed to VssDifferencedFileInfo.FileSpecification

* Plus many things that probably didn't make it into this changelog...

Version 0.8 (alpha)
